MAING GOSL is to simulate detection of a radioactive (point) source which is located in a square, level plain with a detector that flies over the surface at a constant height.

subsidary.py: contains subsidary code, which is used in the simulation. Such as the inverse square function, random radioactive source generation...

zigzag.py: detector flies over the surface in a zig-zag pattern.

spiral.py: the detector roughly locates the location of the radioactive source and then makes measurements while fying outward in a spiral.

location.py: uses LM meathod to solve a overdefined system of equations and with that calculate source location.

combination.py: combines the detector flyover and the location detection.

example.py: shows the capability of the simulation for locating a randomly generated radioactive source.

test1.py: the first test to show that the simualtion is working properly. Comparing the calculated and simulated standard deviation.

parameters.py: contains the adjustable parameters which define the properties of the radiation and detector which are involved in the simulation.

test2.py: simulating location of the source ad different positions in the plain to see if the deviation is not defined by the location of the source.

devToPars.py: displays how the deviation of a source changes when we change the hight of the detector flyover and the amount of time spent at each grid. All for zigzag flyover.

devToParsErrBar.py: the same as devToPars.py, just with the added error bars.
