Main goal: simulate detection of a radioactive (point) source which is located in a square, level plain with a detector that flies over the surface at a constant height.

subsidary.py: contains subsidary code, which is used in the simulation. Such as the inverse square function, random radioactive source generation...

ZIG-ZAG.py: detector flies over the surface in a zig-zag pattern.

spiral.py: the detector roughly locates the location of the radioactive source and then makes measurements while fying outward in a spiral

example.py: shows the capability of the simulation for both ZIG-ZAG and spiral approaches.
